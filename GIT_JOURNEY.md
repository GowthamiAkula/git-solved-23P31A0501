## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Production used port 8080, development used 3000
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Different database hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different feature lists and version numbers
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Divergent logging configuration (INFO vs DEBUG), new fields for experimental environments
- **Resolution**: Merged logging options, included additional fields as optional entries
- **Strategy**: Used YAML anchors and environment variables to unify structure and enable smooth overrides
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 12 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Conflicting connection pool sizes and database timeout values
- **Resolution**: Chose higher pool size and configurable timeout; added explanation in comments
- **Strategy**: Combined both configs, enabling overrides per environment
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Introduction of experimental AI-powered deployment block; accidental “BUG” line inserted during test
- **Resolution**: Merged base script logic, preserved the experimental deployment section (as commented block), removed debug/test lines
- **Strategy**: Kept all stable deployment logic active; retained advanced/experimental code as a named here-document for future development
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 22 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different health check intervals and notification methods (email vs Slack webhook)
- **Resolution**: Created dynamic configuration supporting both notification types, with a priority order
- **Strategy**: Used `process.env` to set notification preference and scheduling logic
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architecture diagrams and section order
- **Resolution**: Merged both diagrams and documentation, ordering sections by deployment flow
- **Strategy**: Included both diagrams under separate headings, clarified each environment’s flow
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 9 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Added/removed badges, divergent setup steps, and version bumps
- **Resolution**: Consolidated badges, clarified setup for all environments, included the latest version notes
- **Strategy**: Made README easier to follow, dividing “Setup” into Production/Development/Experimental subsections
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 12 minutes


## Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**: Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes.

2. **Deciding What to Keep**: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**: deploy.sh had completely different logic. Had to understand both approaches before combining.

4. **Testing After Resolution**: Making sure resolved code actually worked was crucial.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution process
- Understood merge conflict markers
- Learned to use git diff effectively
- Practiced all major Git commands

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides of conflict before resolving
- Test resolved code before committing
- Write detailed merge commit messages
- Use git status frequently
- Commit atomically

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal, not errors
- Take time to understand both changes
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
- Document your resolution strategy
- Keep calm and read carefully

## Reflection
This challenge taught me that merge conflicts aren't scary - they're 
just Git asking "which version do you want?". The key is understanding 
what each side is trying to do before combining them. I now feel 
confident handling conflicts in real projects.

The hands-on practice with all Git commands (especially rebase and 
cherry-pick) was invaluable. I understand the difference between merge 
and rebase, and when to use each. Most importantly, I learned that 
git reflog is a lifesaver!
